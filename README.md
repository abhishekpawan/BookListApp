# BookListApp
This is a simple Book List Web App using #html5 #bootstrap5 and #javascript.
In this you can Add and Delete books which will contain Book Name, Author Name and Book ID(ISBN#).
Also this can save data to Local Storage, so your Added Books will not be vanished when you refresh your tab or exit the browser.
Basic Functionality of this project:
- Adding Books
- Deleting Books
- Showing alert both times when you add a book or delete any books
- If the form is not filed completely and you try to add, the item will not be added to the list and it will show an alert "fill all the fields first".
